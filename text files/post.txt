Hmu. Let's say, like, I used to be super into this one TV show as a teen, and it was, like, hella iconic for me and all my squad. Could u imagine having a fave TV show from when u were a youngin' but now, like, it's literally giving u major eye-rolls when u think about it? So, like, what's that one TV show, amirite?
