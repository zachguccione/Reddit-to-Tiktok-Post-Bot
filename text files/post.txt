I've gotta ask, bruh, what's the hottest social issue that's off the chain right now? Like, where's the heat at? I'm thinking like, do you think climate change is getting the same love as it should be? Or maybe some other stuff like, racial equality or mental health is getting way too much hate, you feel?
