Yeah, it's like, when you're out shopping online or in-store, you gotta consider a few things, you know? First off, you gotta make sure it's fire – I'm talkin' about the style, the design, the whole nine yards. If it looks good, that's a major plus. You gotta feel confident rockin' it, 'cause if you don't look good, you're gonna feel hella self-conscious.

Next up, you gotta scope out the sizing – is it your size, ya feel? You don't wanna be rockin' pants that are too loose or too tight, that's just not fly. You gotta be comfortable, you know?

Lastly, it's got to be budget-friendly. You gotta make sure it's affordable, or else you're gonna be like, *sigh*, "I'ma have to put it off for another day." And who's got time for that?
