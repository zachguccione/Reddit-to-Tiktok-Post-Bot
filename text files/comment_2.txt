I'm low-key shook by The Big Bang Theory. I'm not even hating the laugh tracks, but I'm def over them now, you feel?

By the way, I just had a major epiphany, I was in my early twenties when I first watched that show, and now that I'm a bit more grown, I'm literally freaking out because I'm, like, old. I know, I know, I'm not even 30 yet, but compared to all the younger genz kids out there, I'm, like, ancient. Anyway, yeah, I'm kinda over that show now.
