For real though, Sherlock has always been that show. It gets away with being a total mess because it looks super sleek and on-brand, you feel me? Like, Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are straight up talented actors or something, don't get me wrong. But it's honestly a huge diss to anyone who's into the Sherlock Holmes vibe or mystery novels in general, right? It's all hipster and pretend-intellectual, but it's actually just a watered-down version of the classics.

And can we talk about how it's got Steven Moffat's signature move, which is basically building up to this super-anticipated big reveal, but then it ends up being a total letdown. Like, it's supposed to be this mind-blowing moment, but it's more like, "Hey, I guess that was kinda pointless." It's like a major underwhelming experience, tbh.
