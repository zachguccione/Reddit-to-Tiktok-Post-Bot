Yo, what's poppin'? 

Like, right now, the bullying is just, like, soooo extra and it's wild. I don't know, it just feels like it's, like, taking over your whole life, you feel? And it's honestly super hard to cope with all the drama and the hate. It's literally tearing me apart, like, from the inside out, you know?

As for the future, IDK, man. It's like, I'm literally stuck between hope and fear. I'm hoping that things will get better, that the haters will chill, and that I'll be able to live my life without all the angst. But, like, at the same time, I'm terrified of what might happen next. It's like, what if it just gets worse? What if I can't handle it? 

My heart, though? It's like, it feels heavy, you know? Like, it's carrying all this weight and it's just, like, aching all the time. I feel like I'm walking around with a constant knot in my stomach, just waiting for the next drama-filled day. It's honestly exhausting, bro.
