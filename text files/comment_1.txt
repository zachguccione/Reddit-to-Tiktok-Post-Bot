Yaaas, like, have you noticed how savage people can be nowadays? It's totes crazy how nobody really cares about each other's feelings anymore. Everyone's all about their own little lives and what affects them, straight up. If it doesn't impact them personally, they're just, like, meh. Can't be bothered to even think about others who are struggling.

And, tbh, I think the pandemic really brought out the worst in people. It was like, everyone was stuck at home, but at the same time, nobody really cared that their neighbors were crying for help. I mean, I've seen people on the news, doing, like, literally nothing to help with the pandemic, and it's just wild. They're so focused on their own lives and stuff they're worrying about that they don't even care about the community.

It's not like people didn't use to be jerks or anything, but it feels like this attitude has become even more acceptable lately. I'm low-key worried that if we don't do something to change this, we're gonna lose sight of what's really important. Like, for real. We need to start being better to each other or else...

Oh well, I guess that's just my two cents.
