So like, you know how sometimes you're just chillin' and you're all "I don't know if I'm good enough" and "I'm just pretending like I know what I'm doing"? That's kinda like what most people who deal with imposter syndrome go through. It's this feeling where you're all "I'm totally a fake, I'm just faking it till I make it."

And guess what? It's super common. Like, literally tons of people deal with it. Even some super famous and successful people, like celebrities and business owners, feel like imposters. They're all like "Wow, I don't think I'm as cool as everyone thinks I am," or "I'm just pretending to be this awesome person."

But here's the thing, it's not rare at all. In fact, it's like, super normal. Lots of people have felt like that at some point, even if they don't admit it out loud. It's like this whole "I'm just a normal human being who's pretending to be something I'm not" vibe.
